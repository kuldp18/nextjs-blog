A web developer is responsible for so many tasks from gathering requirements to designing a website, handling its backend part, and also making it live successfully for users. Every year new technology and tools are coming out in industries to boost developers’ productivity and to make the website better for users. It becomes challenging for them to stay on top of the web development game. Today we are going to discuss a complete map to become a web developer in 2021. This will be a practical guideline for all kinds of developers (front-end, backend, and full-stack). Decide Your Goal or Path First We will discuss a lot of technologies, trends, and tools, but we don’t want you to get overwhelmed, so you need to decide first what do you want to do to become a web developer because that will help you to choose the right tools and technology to learn. There are a lot of different reasons to become a web developer some options are given below… You want to work for a company as a web developer which is the most popular and common reason. You want to work as a freelance developer to start your own business or agency. You can become a consultant for other companies. You can create your own app to make money. You want to use this skill to become a content creator. Code as a hobby. From the above area of interest or goal, you can pick up the right tools and technology that is applicable to your goal. If your goal is to become just a front-end developer you can choose the tools and technology of front-end development. The same goes for backend and full-stack development. Basic Tools and Software for Web Development Computer & OS: You can’t write code without a computer and OS running on it. To learn web development you don’t need any kind of fancy computer (If you have one it’s good…). You can use any kind of mid-range laptop or desktop. For the operating system, you can use MacOS, Windows (Latest version), or Linux whatever is comfortable for you. Text Editor / IDE: No doubt VSCode is good for most cases and most languages. It has good performance, great extensions, a built-in terminal, and a ton of features as well. In the 2019 StackOverflow survey VSCode was developers’ first preference as well. You also have some other good options such as Sublime Text, Vim, or Atom. If we talk about IDEs so Visual Studio (ASP.net or C#), Eclipse, and Netbeans (Java). are good options. Web Browser: Most developer’s first choice is either Chrome or Firefox. Chrome is fast, and it uses a V8 engine (JavaScript engine). Firefox has also come a long way and some of its good stuff is not in the Chrome browser. Both browsers have fantastic dev-tools to troubleshoot the issues in web development. Other web browsers to get familiar with are Safari, Edge, and Brave.",
