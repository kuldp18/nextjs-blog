    "content": "Let’s break this down. JavaScript is typically used as a client-side scripting language for front end development. In simple terms, this means that developers use JavaScript to build the part of a website that ordinary visitors can see and interact with, also known as the “front end.” While the programming language can technically be used to create complex programs, its primary application lies in web development. Front end programmers typically use JavaScript in conjunction with two markup languages, HTML and CSS, to create all of the elements that a user can see and interact with directly. Most common actions, such as transactions, submitting customer feedback, and even logging in, are facilitated by HTML code. CSS, on the other hand, centers more on formatting and appearance; it allows developers to describe how the HTML should look to a visitor. Both, however, are static. With only HTML and CSS, a web page is unchanging and relatively simplistic.",

    "content": "Flask was created by Armin Ronacher of Pocoo, an international group of Python enthusiasts formed in 2004.[6] According to Ronacher, the idea was originally an April Fool's joke that was popular enough to make into a serious application.[7][8][9] The name is a play on the earlier Bottle framework.[7] When Ronacher and Georg Brandl created a bulletin board system written in Python in 2004, the Pocoo projects Werkzeug and Jinja were developed.[10] In April 2016, the Pocoo team was disbanded and development of Flask and related libraries passed to the newly formed Pallets project.[11][12] Flask has become popular among Python enthusiasts. As of October 2020, it has second most stars on GitHub among Python web-development frameworks, only slightly behind Django,[13] and was voted the most popular web framework in the Python Developers Survey 2018.[14]",

    "content": "Next.js is a React framework that enables several extra features, including server-side rendering and generating static websites.[7] React is a JavaScript library that is traditionally used to build web applications rendered in the client's browser with JavaScript.[8] Developers recognize several problems with this strategy however, such as not catering to users who do not have access to JavaScript or have disabled it, potential security issues, significantly extended page loading times, and it can harm the site's overall search engine optimization.[8] Frameworks such as Next.js sidestep these problems by allowing some or all of the website to be rendered on the server-side before being sent to the client.[8][9] Next.js is one of the most popular frameworks for React.[10] It is one of several recommended 'toolchains' available when starting a new app, all of which provide a layer of abstraction to aid in common tasks.[11] Next.js requires Node.js and can be initialized using Node Package Manager. Google has donated to the Next.js project, contributing 43 pull requests in 2019, where they helped in pruning unused JavaScript, reducing loading time, and adding improved metrics.[12] As of March 2020, the framework is used by many large websites, including Netflix, GitHub, Uber, Ticketmaster, and Starbucks.[8] In early 2020, it was announced that Vercel had secured twenty-one million dollars in Series A funding to support improvements to the software.[1] The framework's original author, Guillermo Rauch, is currently the CEO of Vercel, and the project's lead developer is Tim Neutkens.[13]",
