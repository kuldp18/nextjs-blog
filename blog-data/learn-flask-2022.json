  "content": "Flask was created by Armin Ronacher of Pocoo, an international group of Python enthusiasts formed in 2004.[6] According to Ronacher, the idea was originally an April Fool's joke that was popular enough to make into a serious application.[7][8][9] The name is a play on the earlier Bottle framework.[7] When Ronacher and Georg Brandl created a bulletin board system written in Python in 2004, the Pocoo projects Werkzeug and Jinja were developed.[10] In April 2016, the Pocoo team was disbanded and development of Flask and related libraries passed to the newly formed Pallets project.[11][12] Flask has become popular among Python enthusiasts. As of October 2020, it has second most stars on GitHub among Python web-development frameworks, only slightly behind Django,[13] and was voted the most popular web framework in the Python Developers Survey 2018.[14]",
